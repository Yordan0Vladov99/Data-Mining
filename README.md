# Data-Mining
A collection of projects that showcase different algorithms and models, that are used for searching and extracting different types of data. The projects are all written in Java. 

Tile-Slide-Puzzle attempts solves the tile sliding puzzle game (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle) using the Iterative Deepeining A* algorithm, using Manhattan Distance as a heuristic.

N-Queens solves the N Queens problem (align N queens on an NxN chessboard withour two queens conflicting with each other).

Genetic-Algorith determines the shortest path between n cities using a genetic algorithm.

Tic-tac-toe simulates a tic-tac-toe who uses the Min-Max algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to pick the best moves.

Naive-Bayes-Classifier trains a predictive model using the naive bayes algorithm in order to predict the party of given politician by looking at his voting history.

Decision-Tree uses a decision tree to determina whether a given breast cancer is recurring or non-recurring.

K-Means uses the K-means++ algorithm to clusterize a given data set.
